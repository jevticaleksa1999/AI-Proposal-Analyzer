# AI-Proposal-Analyzer
AI Proposal Analyzer is a lightweight intelligent tool built with Python (Flask) that analyzes job descriptions and generates tailored proposal insights. It extracts technical skills, soft skills, and keywords, compares them with your personal profile, and produces dynamic, context-aware bullet points you can use when applying for jobs on platforms like Upwork or LinkedIn.

The system uses a rule-based NLP engine to detect skills and patterns, a modular backend architecture (analyzer, models, profile repository), a JSON-based user profile, and a modern dark UI for clean presentation.

Features:

Extracts tech skills, soft skills, and keywords from any job description

Compares extracted skills with your own profile

Highlights matched & missing skills

Generates personalized bullet-point suggestions

Simple, modern UI (HTML/CSS)

Runs locally with Flask

Fully modular folder structure (analyzer, data, templates, static)

Auto-start script via .bat launcher

Ideal for portfolios and job-application workflows, or as a foundation for expanding into a full AI-powered proposal generator.
